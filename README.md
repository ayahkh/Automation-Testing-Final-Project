# Automation-Testing-Final-Project
This is my final project that I've done as part of the Full Stack Test Automation course.. it includes:
* Building an infrastructure that arranges the code appropriately and using ways such as:
 Page Objects Pattern, Root Cause Analyzes.
 * Performing tests on a website (EriBank) and various applications, whilst applying what was
 learnt in the course and using tools such as: Selenium, TestNG, Appium, WebDriverManager, MySQL.
